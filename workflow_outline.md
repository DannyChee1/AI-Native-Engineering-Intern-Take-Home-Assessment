## 1 ¬∑ Why Cursor for AI-Native Development?

Cursor (an AI-powered code editor based on VS Code with built-in AI features for coding assistance) delivers context-aware code completion, one-click "smart rewrite," whole-project semantic search, and tight Git integration. By combining Cursor's capabilities with proven prompting patterns‚Äî**zero/few-shot, system/context/role cues, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency, ReAct, and Step-Back**‚Äîwe can accelerate software modernization while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency.

## 2 ¬∑ End-to-End Modernization Workflow (10 Steps)

| # | Cursor Action (üñ•Ô∏è) | Prompt-Engineering Strategy üí° |
|---|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **0** | *Setup*: Open repo, `git checkout -b refactor-monolith`, enable code-index, configure Cursor Rules for security standards. | Define **system prompt** describing target architecture and coding standards. |
| **1** | *Analysis*: Chat ‚Üí "Analyze this legacy code for architectural issues, security vulnerabilities, and modernization opportunities." | **Zero-shot analysis** with clear, specific prompts for factual assessment. |
| **2** | *Extract modules*: Highlight functions ‚Üí Inline Edit (`‚åò/Ctrl K`) ‚Üí create separate modules (auth.py, database.py). | **Few-shot prompting**: Show one extraction example, then ask AI to repeat the pattern. |
| **3** | *Database migration*: Chat ‚Üí "Create database.py with SQLite integration and SHA-256 password hashing." | **Contextual prompting** ‚Äì reference existing auth.py structure for consistency. |
| **4** | *API development*: Chat ‚Üí "You are a senior Python API engineer. Generate Flask routes for /register, /login, /get_user with proper error handling." | **Role prompting** ensures professional code style and best practices. |
| **5** | *Data migration*: Agent (`‚åÉ/Ctrl I`) ‚Üí "Replace all in-memory user storage with database calls." | **Step-Back**: First ask for migration plan, then execute based on the plan. |
| **6** | *Testing*: Generate unit tests using Chat ‚Üí "Create comprehensive tests for the authentication system." | **Chain-of-Thought**: "Let's think step by step about test coverage." |
| **7** | *Debug & refine*: Paste failing tests ‚Üí "Analyze this error step by step and suggest fixes." | **Self-Consistency**: Run multiple iterations and validate results. |
| **8** | *Integration testing*: Test API endpoints and database operations. | **ReAct pattern**: Reason about issues, test solutions, observe results. |
| **9** | *Documentation*: Generate README and commit messages using AI assistance. | Log all key prompts in `ai_interactions.log` for reproducibility. |

## 3 ¬∑ Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Core Strategies
* **Hierarchy**: **System ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Role** for clear intent and consistent output
* **Specificity**: Include file paths, function names, and exact requirements
* **Iterative refinement**: Start with zero-shot, escalate to few-shot if needed
* **Documentation**: Track successful prompts for team sharing and reuse

### Effective Prompt Patterns
* **Analysis prompts**: "Identify code smells and security issues in [file]"
* **Refactoring prompts**: "Extract [functionality] into a separate module following [pattern]"
* **Implementation prompts**: "Create [component] with [specific requirements]"
* **Debugging prompts**: "Let's analyze this error step by step..."

## 4 ¬∑ Modernization-Specific Techniques

| Modernization Task | Prompt Strategy | Expected Outcome |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Monolith decomposition** | Few-shot + Step-Back | Systematic module extraction with consistent patterns |
| **Security hardening** | System prompt with security rules | Consistent implementation of hashing, validation |
| **Database migration** | Contextual + Role prompting | Proper schema design and migration scripts |
| **API development** | Role-based prompting | RESTful endpoints with proper error handling |
| **Testing strategy** | Chain-of-Thought analysis | Comprehensive test coverage and edge case handling |
