{
  "architectural_issues": [{"file": "path", "issue": "description", "severity": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"}],
  "security_vulnerabilities": [{"file": "path", "vulnerability": "description", "risk_level": "CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM"}],
  "modernization_opportunities": [{"component": "name", "current_pattern": "description", "suggested_pattern": "description"}]
}
```

### Step 2: Module Extraction

**Cursor Action (üñ•Ô∏è):**
- Highlight functions ‚Üí Inline Edit (`‚åò/Ctrl K`) ‚Üí create separate modules

**Prompt-Engineering Strategy (üí°):**
```markdown
**Few-shot Extraction Prompt:**
Extract authentication functions into a separate module following this pattern:

**EXAMPLE:**
```python
# Before: Mixed in main.py
def login_user(username, password):
    # authentication logic
    return user

def register_user(username, password):
    # registration logic  
    return user
```

**EXTRACTED TO:**
```python
# auth.py
class AuthManager:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db = db_connection
    
    def login_user(self, username, password):
        # authentication logic
        return user
    
    def register_user(self, username, password):
        # registration logic
        return user
```

Now extract the database functions from main.py into database.py following the same pattern.
```

### Step 3: Database Migration

```markdown
**CoT Prompt Example:**
"Let's think step by step about refactoring this authentication system:

1. What are the current authentication methods?
2. What security vulnerabilities exist?
3. What modern authentication patterns should we implement?
4. How do we migrate without breaking existing functionality?
5. What testing strategy ensures security?

Based on this analysis, provide a step-by-step refactoring plan."
```

### 3.4 Self-Consistency for Reliable Results

```markdown
**Self-Consistency Process:**
1. Generate multiple solutions to the same problem
2. Compare and identify common patterns
3. Select the most consistent approach
4. Validate against requirements

**Example:** Run the same refactoring prompt 3-5 times and identify the most reliable pattern.
```

### 3.5 Step-Back Prompting for Strategic Thinking

```markdown
**Step-Back Process:**
1. **Step Back:** "What are the fundamental principles of good software architecture?"
2. **Apply:** "How do these principles apply to our specific refactoring task?"
3. **Execute:** "Implement the solution based on these principles"

**Example:** Instead of directly asking "How do I fix this bug?", first ask "What are the common causes of this type of bug?"
```
